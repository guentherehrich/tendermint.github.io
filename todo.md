# Stuff done wednesday
* Worked on improving the design of the marketing site.
* Lots of refactoring of HTML, splitting up the massive homepage index.html into partials.
* Simplified a lot of the CSS IDs to prevent too much cascading of styles, reducing CSS conflicts.
* Moved the custom icon library into the repository instead of using a CDN.
